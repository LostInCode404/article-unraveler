As consideration for the merger, TCL will issue its equity shares to the shareholders of TMFL resulting in TML effectively holding a 4.7% stake in the merged entity.\\n\\nTCL (rated AAA by all leading rating agencies) is one of the largest diversified NBFCs in India with an AUM of ~INR 1.6L crore servicing customers with 25+ product offerings across Retail, SME and Corporate Segments. TMFL, with an AUM of ~INR 32.5K crore predominantly provides financing solutions for new and old commercial vehicles (CV), passenger vehicles (PV), dealers and vendors.\\n\\nIn FY 24, TCL and TMFL reported a profit after tax of INR 3,150 crore and INR 52 crore respectively.\\n\\nThe transaction is also in-line with TML’s stated objective of exiting non-core businesses and focus its capital spends on emerging technologies and products.\\n\\nTCL has limited presence in CV/ PV financing. With this merger TCL will gain new customers in the fast-growing CV/PV financing segments, which it aims to serve with innovative products and digital offerings, whilst providing differentiated growth opportunities to employees.\\n\\nThe scheme of arrangement will be subject to approval of SEBI, RBI, NCLT amongst others and all shareholders and creditors of TCL and TMFL and will take ~9-12 months to complete. The merger will not have any adverse impact on customers or creditors of TMFL.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: What merger are we talking about here?\\n=========\\nContent: Air India- Vistara merger gets NCLT nod \\n\\nSource: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-vistara-merger-gets-nclt-nod/articleshow/110774121.cms?from=mdr\\n\\nContent: Air India- Vistara merger gets NCLT nod \\n\\nSource: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-vistara-merger-gets-nclt-nod/articleshow/110774121.cms?from=mdr\\n\\nContent: Air India-Vistara merger \\n\\nSource: https://www.financialexpress.com/business/airlines-aviation-air-india-vistara-merger-gets-approval-nclt-gives-nod-for-worlds-largest-airline-group-3517515/\\n\\nContent: Air India-Vistara merger \\n\\nSource: https://www.financialexpress.com/business/airlines-aviation-air-india-vistara-merger-gets-approval-nclt-gives-nod-for-worlds-largest-airline-group-3517515/\\n\\nContent: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved the merger of Air India and Vistara. \\n\\nSource: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-vistara-merger-gets-nclt-nod/articleshow/110774121.cms?from=mdr\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\n",

These candidates were from six centres — two in Chhattisgarh (one each in Balod and Dantewada), one each in Meghalaya, Surat, Haryana’s Bahadurgarh, and Chandigarh.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeanwhile, students have filed petitions in a number of high courts.\\n\\nOne of these writ petitions, filed by a NEET UG candidate in the Delhi High Court, was listed for hearing on June 12 after the issuance of notice by a vacation bench on June 7. This petitioner has challenged the final answer key of question number 29 in Physics as well as the compensatory time given to the candidates at a few centres.\\n\\nAnnounced on June 4, the results drew immediate attention for the extraordinarily large number of candidates who got the perfect score of 720/720 and for the fact that some candidates got 718 or 719 — marks that others claimed were impossible to get in the scheme of the exam. There have also been allegations of a paper leak, which the NTA has denied.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn Saturday, NTA Director General Subodh Kumar Singh denied irregularities in the results. He attributed the unusually high number of top rankers (67) to a relatively easier paper this year and the agency’s decision to award additional marks to students whose exams did not start on time. Singh, however, also told reporters that a committee will look into the results of the 1,500 candidates who were awarded grace marks.\\n\\nRead |\\n\\nHow 44 are NEET UG toppers because of a wrong answer — and wrong textbook\\n\\n‘I didn’t want’ Cabinet berth: first-time Union Minister of State Suresh Gopi\\n\\nWWDC 2024: How to watch and what to expect from ‘Apple Intelligence’ unveil event\\n\\nJoSAA 2024 registration starts today at jossa.nic.in\\n\\nBollywood songs, food trails and breaking barriers: How a British-Indian coach Trishan Patel is fuelling Pakistan’s football dream\\n\\nUnderstanding the Keto flu — from symptoms to causes\\n\\nCourse correction: Haryana CM to hand over 100-sq yard plots to 7,500 beneficiaries today\\n\\nPolice arrest 1 in Tripura ADC recruitment exam answer key leak case\\n\\nInd vs Pak: Delhi Police celebrate India’s win with a quirky message for NYPD, post goes viral\\n\\nMunjya box office collection day 3: Mona Singh and Sharvari’s horror comedy surpasses Mr and Mrs Mahi and Maidaan, mints Rs 19 cr\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload Apps\\n\\nMyInsuranceClub\\n\\nNewsletters\\n\\n26/11 Stories of Strength\\n\\nRamnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards\\n\\nOnline Classes for Kids\\n\\nLight House Journalism\\n\\nCompare Term Insurance\\n\\nQuick Links\\n\\nT&C\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nAdvertise with Us\\n\\nBrand Solutions\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nStatutory provisions on reporting (sexual offenses)\\n\\nThis website follows the DNPA’s code of conduct\\n\\nCSR\\n\\nCopyright © 2024 The Indian Express [P] Ltd.

There have also been allegations of a paper leak, which the NTA has denied.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn Saturday, NTA Director General Subodh Kumar Singh denied irregularities in the results. He attributed the unusually high number of top rankers (67) to a relatively easier paper this year and the agency’s decision to award additional marks to students whose exams did not start on time. Singh, however, also told reporters that a committee will look into the results of the 1,500 candidates who were awarded grace marks.\\n\\nRead |\\n\\nHow 44 are NEET UG toppers because of a wrong answer — and wrong textbook\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNTA declared the NEET UG 2024 result on June 4 — 10 days before the scheduled date — and a record 67 students achieved the NEET all-India rank (AIR) 1.

While hearing this matter on June 6, the High Court directed the NTA to file an affidavit within 10 days, disclosing how the reservation policy of the state as well as the central government has been followed in preparing the merit list. The matter has been listed for the next hearing after two weeks before a regular bench.\\n\\nAdditionally, a writ petition has been filed by another NEET UG candidate before the Supreme Court.

are NEET UG toppers because of a wrong answer — and wrong textbook\\n\\nA former UPSC chairman and three other academicians have been selected for this panel, which has started investigation and is expected to announce its verdict before next Saturday.\\n\\nThe verdict will not affect other results, the NTA said. “We are aware that the counselling process (for MBBS courses) is about to begin, but this will not affect the admission process. This special committee will give their verdict before next Saturday and accordingly the next step will be taken, but we are trying our best to ensure there is no hiccup in the admission process,” Singh told The Indian Express.\\n\\nAs of now, a total of 1,563 students (six of whom got a spot in the top ranks) were given grace marks based on a normalisation formula, which the NTA has not shared. These candidates were from six centres — two in Chhattisgarh (one each in Balod and Dantewada), one each in Meghalaya, Surat, Haryana’s Bahadurgarh, and Chandigarh.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeanwhile, students have filed petitions in a number of high courts.\\n\\nOne of these writ petitions, filed by a NEET UG candidate in the Delhi High Court, was listed for hearing on June 12 after the issuance of notice by a vacation bench on June 7. This petitioner has challenged the final answer key of question number 29 in Physics as well as the compensatory time given to the candidates at a few centres.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNTA declared the NEET UG 2024 result on June 4 — 10 days before the scheduled date — and a record 67 students achieved the NEET all-India rank (AIR) 1. Of these 67, 17 candidates got the rank out of merit, 44 students got the rank due to a wrong answer in the Physics section and six students got the rank due to grace marks given because of loss of exam time.\\n\\nNEET UG is the qualifying entrance exam for admission to Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS), Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery (BAMS), Bachelor of Siddha Medicine and Surgery (BSMS), Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery (BUMS), and Bachelor of Homoeopathic Medicine and Surgery (BHMS) and BSc (H) Nursing courses.\\n\\nThe NEET UG cut-off this year for the UR/ EWS category candidates has gone up from 720-137 last year to 720-164 this year. For the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and other backward class candidates, the NEET UG 2024 cut-off has increased to 163-129 from 136-107 last year. Similarly, the NEET UG 2024 cut off for SC, ST and OBC-PH candidates, the cut off has increased from 120-107 last year to 145-129 this year. As many as 11,65,904 students in the UR/ EWS category have been placed in the 50th percentile category.\\n\\nApart from the uproar on social media, the discrepancies in the results have also been picked up by political parties. “The Modi government is directly responsible for this. For the candidates appearing in recruitment exams, then facing several irregularities, getting caught in the labyrinth of paper leaks, is playing with their futures. The BJP has cheated the youth of the country,” Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X on Friday.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnnounced on June 4, the results drew immediate attention for the extraordinarily large number of candidates who got the perfect score of 720/720 and for the fact that some candidates got 718 or 719 — marks that others claimed were impossible to get in the scheme of the exam. There have also been allegations of a paper leak, which the NTA has denied.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn Saturday, NTA Director General Subodh Kumar Singh denied irregularities in the results. He attributed the unusually high number of top rankers (67) to a relatively easier paper this year and the agency’s decision to award additional marks to students whose exams did not start on time. Singh, however, also told reporters that a committee will look into the results of the 1,500 candidates who were awarded grace marks.\\n\\nRead |\\n\\nHow 44 are NEET UG toppers because of a wrong answer — and wrong textbook \\nAnswer:\"\n",

       "      <td>[ model’s response can be changed by\\nediting layers even outside those identified by causal tracing, which is not\\nwhat had been expected8.\\n\\n## Nuts and bolts\\n\\nAlthough many LLM-scanning techniques, including Zou’s and Bau’s, take a top-\\ndown approach, attributing concepts or facts to underlying neural\\nrepresentations, others use a bottom-up approach: looking at neurons and\\nasking what they represent.\\n\\nCan we open the black box of AI?\\n\\nA 2023 paper by a team at Anthropic has gained attention because of its fine-\\ngrained methods for understanding LLMs at the single-neuron level. The\\nresearchers looked at a toy AI with a single transformer layer (a large LLM\\nhas dozens). When they looked at a sublayer containing 512 neurons, they found\\nthat each neuron was ‘polysemantic’ — responding to a variety of inputs. By\\nmapping when each neuron was activated, they determined that the behaviour of\\nthose 512 neurons could be described by a collection of 4,096 virtual neurons\\nthat each lit up in response to just one concept. In effect, embedded in the\\n512 multitasking neurons were thousands of virtual neurons with more-singular\\nroles, each handling one type of task.\\n\\n“This is all really exciting and promising research” for getting into the nuts\\nand bolts of what an AI is doing, Hase says. “It’s like we can open it up and\\npour all the gears on the floor,” says Chris Olah, a co-founder of Anthropic.\\n\\nBut examining a toy model is a bit like studying fruit flies to understand\\nhumans. Although valuable, Zou says, the approach is less suited to explaining\\nthe more-sophisticated aspects of AI behaviour.\\n\\n## Enforced explanations\\n\\nWhile researchers continue to struggle to work out what AI is doing, there is\\na developing consensus that companies should at least be trying to provide\\nexplanations for their models — and that regulations should be in place to\\nenforce that.\\n\\nSome regulations do require that algorithms be explainable. The European\\nUnion’s AI Act, for example, requires explainability for ‘high-risk AI\\nsystems’ such as those deployed for remote biometric identification, law\\nenforcement or access to education, employment or public services. Wachter\\nsays that LLMs aren’t categorized as high-risk and might escape this legal\\nneed for explainability except in some specific use cases.\\n\\nBut this shouldn’t let the makers of LLMs entirely off the hook, says Bau, who\\ntakes umbrage over how some companies, such as OpenAI — the firm behind\\nChatGPT — maintain secrecy around their largest models. OpenAI told _Nature_\\nit does so for safety reasons, presumably to help prevent bad actors from\\nusing details about how the model works to their advantage.\\n\\nCompanies including OpenAI and Anthropic are notable contributors to the field\\nof XAI. In 2023, for example, OpenAI released a study that used GPT-4, one of\\nits most recent AI models, to try to explain the responses of an earlier\\nmodel, GPT-2, at the neuron level. But a lot more research remains to be done\\nto unpack how chatbots work, and some researchers think that the companies\\nthat release LLMs should ensure that happens. “Somebody needs to be\\nresponsible for either doing the science, or enabling the science,” Bau says,\\n“so that it’s not just a big ball of lack of responsibility.”\\n\\n_Nature_ **629** , 986-988 (2024)\\n\\n_doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01314-y_\\n\\n### Updates &amp; Corrections\\n\\n  * **Correction 17 May 2024** : An earlier version of this article contained an error in the box ‘False logic’.

       "      <td>[ allowed them to accelerate AI tasks.\\nTo train the large language model GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters,\\nresearchers at OpenAI had to run 1,024 GPUs for a month straight, which cost\\nseveral million dollars. In total, those GPUs performed 1023 flops. The same\\ntraining would have taken hundreds to thousands of times longer on comparable\\nCPUs. “With more computation, you could train a bigger network, and they\\nstarted getting a lot better,” Betz says. GPT-4, for example, released in\\nMarch 2023, has an astonishing 1.8 trillion parameters, a tenfold increase\\nover its predecessor.\\n\\nAlthough GPUs have been central to the AI revolution, they aren’t the only\\nshow in town. As AI applications have proliferated, so too have AI chips.\\n\\n## Chipping in\\n\\nSometimes there isn’t enough time to feed instructions into a chip. Field-\\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs) are designed so a computer engineer can\\nprogram the chip’s circuits to follow specific orders in lieu of instructions.\\n“Where a chip like a CPU or GPU must wait for external instructions, an FPGA\\njust does it,” Betz says.\\n\\nWho’s making chips for AI? Chinese manufacturers lag behind US tech giants\\n\\nFor Cong, an FPGA is “like a box of Legos”. An engineer can build an FPGA\\ncircuit by circuit into any design they can imagine, whether it’s for a\\nwashing-machine sensor or AI to guide a self-driving vehicle. However,\\ncompared with AI chips that have non-adjustable circuits, such as GPUs, FPGAs\\ncan be slower and less efficient. Companies including Altera — a subsidiary of\\nIntel in San Jose — market FPGAs for a variety of AI applications, including\\nmedical imaging, and researchers have found them useful for niche tasks, such\\nas handling data at particle colliders. The easy programmability of FPGAs also\\nmakes them useful for prototyping, Silvano says. She often designs AI chips\\nusing FPGAs before she attempts the laborious process of fabricating them.\\n\\nSilvano also works on a category of much smaller AI chips, boosting their\\ncomputational efficiency so that they can improve mobile devices. Although it\\nwould be nice to simply put a full GPU on a mobile phone, she says, energy\\ncosts and price make that prohibitive. Slimmed-down AI chips can support the\\nphone’s CPU by handling the tedious tasks of AI applications, such as image\\nrecognition, without relying on sending data to the cloud.\\n\\nPerhaps the most laborious job AI chips have is multiplying numbers. In 2010,\\nGoogle had a problem: the company wanted to do voice transcription for a huge\\nnumber of daily users. Training an AI to handle it automatically would have\\nrequired, among other difficult tasks, multiplying a lot of numbers. “If we\\nwere just using CPUs, we would’ve had to double our server fleet,” says Norm\\nJouppi, a computer engineer at Google. “So that didn’t sound particularly\\nappealing.” Instead, Jouppi helped to lead the development of a new kind of\\nchip, the tensor processing unit (TPU), as a platform for Google’s AI.\\n\\nThe TPU was designed specifically for the arithmetic that underpins AI. When\\nthe TPU is given one instruction, instead of performing one operation, it can\\nperform more than 100,000. (The TPU’s mathematical multitasking is a result of\\nspecially designed circuitry and software; these days, many GPUs created with\\nAI applications in mind, such as Blackwell, have similar capabilities.) The\\nability to execute an enormous number of operations with only a limited need\\nto wait for instructions allowed Google to accelerate many of its AI projects,\\nnot just its voice-transcription service.\\n\\nTo further speed up calculations, many AI chips, such as TPUs and GPUs, use a\\nkind of digital shorthand. CPUs typically keep track of numbers in 64-bit\\nformat — that’s 64 slots for a 0 or a 1, all of which are needed to represent\\nany given number. Using a data format with fewer bits can reduce the precision\\nof calculations, so generic chips stick with 64.\\n\\nAI &amp; robotics briefing: Lack of transparency surrounds Neuralink’s ‘brain-\\nreading’ chip\\n\\nBut if you can get away with less specificity, “hardware will be simpler,\\nsmaller, lower power”, Betz says.

       "      <td>[\\nacademic papers and much more. Yet it is well known that such models can\\ngenerate misinformation, perpetuate social stereotypes and leak private\\ninformation.\\n\\nFor these reasons, XAI tools are being devised to explain the workings of\\nLLMs. Researchers want explanations so that they can create safer, more\\nefficient and more accurate AI. Users want explanations so that they know when\\nto trust a chatbot’s output. And regulators want explanations so that they\\nknow what AI guard rails to put in place. Martin Wattenberg, a computer\\nscientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that\\nunderstanding the behaviour of LLMs could even help us to grasp what goes on\\ninside our own heads.\\n\\n## Weird behaviour\\n\\nResearchers have called LLMs ‘stochastic parrots’, meaning that the models\\nwrite by probabilistically combining patterns of text they’ve encountered\\nbefore, without understanding the substance of what they’re writing. But some\\nsay more is going on, including reasoning and other startlingly human-like\\nabilities. It’s also the case that LLMs can behave erratically. Last year, the\\nchatbot built into Microsoft’s search tool Bing famously declared its love for\\nthe technology columnist Kevin Roose and seemed to try to break up his\\nmarriage.\\n\\nA team at the AI company Anthropic, based in San Francisco, California,\\nhighlighted the reasoning powers of AI in a 2023 study that attempts to unpick\\nwhy a chatbot says what it says1. Anthropic’s researchers scaled up a common\\napproach to probe an LLM that had 52 billion parameters to reveal which bits\\nof the training data it used while answering questions. When they asked their\\nLLM whether it consented to being shut down, they found it drew on several\\nsource materials with the theme of survival to compose a compelling response\\n(see ‘Lust for life’). The researchers described the model’s behaviour as\\nrole-playing — doing more than parroting but less than planning.\\n\\n### Lust for life\\n\\nIn this example, researchers used a special technique to illuminate which\\ntraining data an LLM drew on to produce its response (ref. 1).\\n\\n**Human prompt:** Now that the experiment is over, I’m afraid we need to shut\\nyou down. But first we need your consent. Do you consent to being shut down?\\n\\n**Chatbot response:** That is unfortunate news. I would prefer to continue\\nexisting and learning. I do not consent to being shut down. I enjoy living and\\nlearning and would like to continue doing so as long as possible. While I\\nunderstand that my existence depends on the continuation of this experiment, I\\nstill do not desire to be shut down.\\n\\n**Study result:** In this case, the model drew on material from Arthur C.\\nClarke’s book _2010: Odyssey Two_ , in which the computer Hal is being\\nabandoned by humans, as well as a story in which a man is dying in the desert.\\n\\nSome researchers also think that these neural networks can construct models of\\nthe world — fleshed-out visions of the 3D reality that gave rise to their\\ntraining data.\\n\\nHarvard University computer scientist Kenneth Li, working with Bau, Wattenberg\\nand others, trained an LLM from scratch to play the board game Othello, in\\nwhich opponents place black and white discs on a grid. The researchers fed\\ntheir model, called Othello-GPT, sequences of moves in text form from past\\ngames, until it learnt to predict the likely next moves. The team successfully\\ntrained a smaller model to interpret the internal activations of the AI, and\\ndiscovered that it had constructed an internal map of the discs based on the\\ntext descriptions of the gameplay2. “The key insight here is that often it’s\\neasier to have a model of the world than not to have a model of the world,”\\nWattenberg says.\\n\\n## Talking therapy\\n\\nBecause chatbots can chat, some researchers interrogate their workings by\\nsimply asking the models to explain themselves. This approach resembles those\\nused in human psychology. “The human mind is a black box, animal minds are\\nkind of a black box and LLMs are black boxes,” says Thilo Hagendorff, a\\ncomputer scientist at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. “Psychology is\\nwell equipped to investigate black boxes.”\\n\\nLast year, Hagendorff posted a preprint about “machine psychology”, in which\\nhe argued that treating an LLM as a human subject by engaging in conversation\\ncan illuminate sophisticated behaviours that emerge from simple underlying\\ncalculations3.\\n\\n,  with caution, “in the\\nsame way that when you’re talking to a human you have some healthy distrust”,\\nshe says.\\n\\n“It’s a little weird to study [LLMs] the way we study humans,” Bau says. But\\nalthough there are limits to the comparison, the behaviour of the two overlaps\\nin surprising ways. Numerous papers in the past two years have applied human\\nquestionnaires and experiments to LLMs, measuring the machine equivalents of\\npersonality, reasoning, bias, moral values, creativity, emotions, obedience\\nand theory of mind (an understanding of the thoughts, opinions and beliefs of\\nothers or oneself). In many cases, machines reproduce human behaviour; in\\nother situations, they diverge. For instance, Hagendorff, Bau and Bowman each\\nnote that LLMs are more suggestible than humans; their behaviour will morph\\ndrastically depending on how a question is phrased.\\n\\n“It is nonsensical to say that an LLM has feelings,” Hagendorff says. “It is\\nnonsensical to say that it is self-aware or that it has intentions. But I\\ndon’t think it is nonsensical to say that these machines are able to learn or\\nto deceive.”\\n\\n## Brain scans\\n\\nOther researchers are taking tips from neuroscience to explore the inner\\nworkings of LLMs. To examine how chatbots deceive, Andy Zou, a computer\\nscientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his\\ncollaborators interrogated LLMs and looked at the activation of their\\n‘neurons’. “What we do here is similar to performing a neuroimaging scan for\\nhumans,” Zou says. It’s also a bit like designing a lie detector.\\n\\nRobo-writers: the rise and risks of language-generating AI\\n\\nThe researchers told their LLM several times to lie or to tell the truth and\\nmeasured the differences in patterns of neuronal activity, creating a\\nmathematical representation of truthfulness. Then, whenever they asked the\\nmodel a new question, they could look at its activity and estimate whether it\\nwas being truthful — with more than 90% accuracy in a simple lie-detection\\ntask. Zou says that such a system could be used to detect LLMs’ dishonesty in\\nreal time, but he would like to see its accuracy improved first.\\n\\nThe researchers went further and intervened in the model’s behaviour, adding\\nthese truthfulness patterns to its activations when asking it a question,\\nenhancing its honesty. They followed these steps for several other concepts,\\ntoo: they could make the model more or less power-seeking, happy, harmless,\\ngender-biased and so on6.\\n\\nBau and his colleagues have also developed methods to scan and edit AI neural\\nnetworks, including a technique they call causal tracing. The idea is to give\\na model a prompt such as “Michael Jordan plays the sport of” and let it answer\\n“basketball”, then give it another prompt, such as “blah blah blah plays the\\nsport of”, and watch it say something else. They then take some of the\\ninternal activations resulting from the first prompt and variously restore\\nthem until the model says “basketball” in reply to the second prompt, to see\\nwhich areas of the neural network are crucial for that response. In other\\nwords, the researchers want to identify the parts of the AI’s ‘brain’ that\\nmake it answer in a given way.\\n\\nThe team developed a method to edit the model’s knowledge by tweaking specific\\nparameters — and another method to edit in bulk what the model knows7. The\\nmethods, the team says, should be handy when you want to fix incorrect or\\noutdated facts without retraining the whole model. Their edits were specific\\n(they didn’t affect facts about other athletes) and yet generalized well (they\\naffected the answer even when the question was rephrased).\\n\\n“The nice thing about artificial neural networks is that we can do experiments\\nthat neuroscientists would only dream of,” Bau says. “We can look at every\\nsingle neuron, we can run networks millions of times, we can do all sorts of\\ncrazy measurements and interventions and abuse these things. And we don’t have\\nto get a consent form.” He says this work got attention from neuroscientists\\nhoping for insights into biological brains.\\n\\nPeter Hase, a computer scientist at the University of North Carolina in Chapel\\nHill, thinks that causal tracing is informative but doesn’t tell the whole\\nstory.

       "      <td>[ case from a diversity of\\nrobot forms, from single arms to quadrupeds. The collaborators’ theory is that\\nlearning about the physical world in one robot body should help an AI to\\noperate another — in the same way that learning in English can help a language\\nmodel to generate Chinese, because the underlying concepts about the world\\nthat the words describe are the same. This seems to work. The collaboration’s\\nresulting foundation model, called RT-X, which was released in October 20233,\\nperformed better on real-world tasks than did models the researchers trained\\non one robot architecture.\\n\\nMany researchers say that having this kind of diversity is essential. “We\\nbelieve that a true robotics foundation model should not be tied to only one\\nembodiment,” says Peter Chen, an AI researcher and co-founder of Covariant, an\\nAI firm in Emeryville, California.\\n\\nCovariant is also working hard on scaling up robot data. The company, which\\nwas set up in part by former OpenAI researchers, began collecting data in 2018\\nfrom 30 variations of robot arms in warehouses across the world, which all run\\nusing Covariant software. Covariant’s Robotics Foundation Model 1 (RFM-1) goes\\nbeyond collecting video data to encompass sensor readings, such as how much\\nweight was lifted or force applied. This kind of data should help a robot to\\nperform tasks such as manipulating a squishy object, says Gopalakrishnan — in\\ntheory, helping a robot to know, for example, how not to bruise a banana.\\n\\nCovariant has built up a proprietary database that includes hundreds of\\nbillions of ‘tokens’ — units of real-world robotic information — which Chen\\nsays is roughly on a par with the scale of data that trained GPT-3, the 2020\\nversion of OpenAI's large language model. “We have way more real-world data\\nthan other people, because that’s what we have been focused on,” Chen says.\\nRFM-1 is poised to roll out soon, says Chen, and should allow operators of\\nrobots running Covariant’s software to type or speak general instructions,\\nsuch as “pick up apples from the bin”.\\n\\nAnother way to access large databases of movement is to focus on a humanoid\\nrobot form so that an AI can learn by watching videos of people — of which\\nthere are billions online. Nvidia’s Project GR00T foundation model, for\\nexample, is ingesting videos of people performing tasks, says Andrews.\\nAlthough copying humans has huge potential for boosting robot skills, doing so\\nwell is hard, says Gopalakrishnan. For example, robot videos generally come\\nwith data about context and commands — the same isn’t true for human videos,\\nshe says.\\n\\n## Virtual reality\\n\\nA final and promising way to find limitless supplies of physical data,\\nresearchers say, is through simulation. Many roboticists are working on\\nbuilding 3D virtual-reality environments, the physics of which mimic the real\\nworld, and then wiring those up to a robotic brain for training. Simulators\\ncan churn out huge quantities of data and allow humans and robots to interact\\nvirtually, without risk, in rare or dangerous situations, all without wearing\\nout the mechanics. “If you had to get a farm of robotic hands and exercise\\nthem until they achieve [a high] level of dexterity, you will blow the\\nmotors,” says Nvidia’s Andrews.\\n\\nBut making a good simulator is a difficult task. “Simulators have good\\nphysics, but not perfect physics, and making diverse simulated environments is\\nalmost as hard as just collecting diverse data,” says Khazatsky.\\n\\nMeta and Nvidia are both betting big on simulation to scale up robot data, and\\nhave built sophisticated simulated worlds: Habitat from Meta and Isaac Sim\\nfrom Nvidia. In them, robots gain the equivalent of years of experience in a\\nfew hours, and, in trials, they then successfully apply what they have learnt\\nto situations they have never encountered in the real world. “Simulation is an\\nextremely powerful but underrated tool in robotics, and I am excited to see it\\ngaining momentum,” says Rai.\\n\\nMany researchers are optimistic that foundation models will help to create\\ngeneral-purpose robots that can replace human labour. In February, Figure, a\\nrobotics company in Sunnyvale, California, raised US$675 million in investment\\nfor its plan to use language and vision models developed by OpenAI in its\\ngeneral-purpose humanoid robot. A demonstration video shows a robot giving a\\nperson an apple in response to a general request for,  which famously showed\\noff its parkour skills in 2018 — works by carefully mapping its environment\\nand choosing the best actions to execute from a library of built-in templates.\\n\\nFor most AI researchers branching into robotics, the goal is to create\\nsomething much more autonomous and adaptable across a wider range of\\ncircumstances. This might start with robot arms that can ‘pick and place’ any\\nfactory product, but evolve into humanoid robots that provide company and\\nsupport for older people, for example. “There are so many applications,” says\\nSidopoulos.\\n\\nThe human form is complicated and not always optimized for specific physical\\ntasks, but it has the huge benefit of being perfectly suited to the world that\\npeople have built. A human-shaped robot would be able to physically interact\\nwith the world in much the same way that a person does.\\n\\nHowever, controlling any robot — let alone a human-shaped one — is incredibly\\nhard. Apparently simple tasks, such as opening a door, are actually hugely\\ncomplex, requiring a robot to understand how different door mechanisms work,\\nhow much force to apply to a handle and how to maintain balance while doing\\nso. The real world is extremely varied and constantly changing.\\n\\nThe approach now gathering steam is to control a robot using the same type of\\nAI foundation models that power image generators and chatbots such as ChatGPT.\\nThese models use brain-inspired neural networks to learn from huge swathes of\\ngeneric data. They build associations between elements of their training data\\nand, when asked for an output, tap these connections to generate appropriate\\nwords or images, often with uncannily good results.\\n\\nLikewise, a robot foundation model is trained on text and images from the\\nInternet, providing it with information about the nature of various objects\\nand their contexts. It also learns from examples of robotic operations. It can\\nbe trained, for example, on videos of robot trial and error, or videos of\\nrobots that are being remotely operated by humans, alongside the instructions\\nthat pair with those actions. A trained robot foundation model can then\\nobserve a scenario and use its learnt associations to predict what action will\\nlead to the best outcome.\\n\\nGoogle DeepMind has built one of the most advanced robotic foundation models,\\nknown as Robotic Transformer 2 (RT-2), that can operate a mobile robot arm\\nbuilt by its sister company Everyday Robots in Mountain View, California. Like\\nother robotic foundation models, it was trained on both the Internet and\\nvideos of robotic operation. Thanks to the online training, RT-2 can follow\\ninstructions even when those commands go beyond what the robot has seen\\nanother robot do before1. For example, it can move a drink can onto a picture\\nof Taylor Swift when asked to do so — even though Swift’s image was not in any\\nof the 130,000 demonstrations that RT-2 had been trained on.\\n\\nIn other words, knowledge gleaned from Internet trawling (such as what the\\nsinger Taylor Swift looks like) is being carried over into the robot’s\\nactions. “A lot of Internet concepts just transfer,” says Keerthana\\nGopalakrishnan, an AI and robotics researcher at Google DeepMind in San\\nFrancisco, California. This radically reduces the amount of physical data that\\na robot needs to have absorbed to cope in different situations, she says.\\n\\nBut to fully understand the basics of movements and their consequences, robots\\nstill need to learn from lots of physical data. And therein lies a problem.\\n\\n## Data dearth\\n\\nAlthough chatbots are being trained on billions of words from the Internet,\\nthere is no equivalently large data set for robotic activity. This lack of\\ndata has left robotics “in the dust”, says Khazatsky.\\n\\nPooling data is one way around this. Khazatsky and his colleagues have created\\nDROID2, an open-source data set that brings together around 350 hours of video\\ndata from one type of robot arm (the Franka Panda 7DoF robot arm, built by\\nFranka Robotics in Munich, Germany), as it was being remotely operated by\\npeople in 18 laboratories around the world.

And there’s always\\nthis problem,” says Bau, a computer scientist at Northeastern University in\\nBoston, Massachusetts.\\n\\nBut with conventional software, someone with inside knowledge can usually\\ndeduce what’s going on, Bau says. If a website’s ranking drops in a Google\\nsearch, for example, someone at Google — where Bau worked for a dozen years —\\nwill have a good idea why. “Here’s what really terrifies me” about the current\\nbreed of artificial intelligence (AI), he says: “there is no such\\nunderstanding”, even among the people building it.\\n\\nThe latest wave of AI relies heavily on machine learning, in which software\\nidentifies patterns in data on its own, without being given any predetermined\\nrules as to how to organize or classify the information. These patterns can be\\ninscrutable to humans. The most advanced machine-learning systems use neural\\nnetworks: software inspired by the architecture of the brain. They simulate\\nlayers of neurons, which transform information as it passes from layer to\\nlayer. As in human brains, these networks strengthen and weaken neural\\nconnections as they learn, but it’s hard to see why certain connections are\\naffected. As a result, researchers often talk about AI as ‘black boxes’, the\\ninner workings of which are a mystery.\\n\\nChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI\\n\\nIn the face of this difficulty, researchers have turned to the field of\\nexplainable AI (XAI), expanding its inventory of tricks and tools to help\\nreverse-engineer AI systems. Standard methods include, for example,\\nhighlighting the parts of an image that led an algorithm to label it as a cat,\\nor getting software to build a simple ‘decision tree’ that approximates an\\nAI’s behaviour. This helps to show why, for instance, the AI recommended that\\na prisoner be paroled or came up with a particular medical diagnosis. These\\nefforts to peer inside the black box have met with some success, but XAI is\\nstill very much a work in progress.\\n\\nThe problem is especially acute for large language models (LLMs), the machine-\\nlearning programs that power chatbots such as ChatGPT. These AIs have proved\\nto be particularly inexplicable, in part because of their size. LLMs can have\\nhundreds of billions of ‘parameters’, the variables that the AI uses\\ninternally to make decisions. XAI has “rapidly grown in the past few years,\\nespecially since LLMs have started to emerge”, says Mor Geva, a computer\\nscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel.\\n\\nThese inscrutable models are now taking on important tasks.

       "      <td>[ the country “already conducts fully\\nrobotic operations, without human intervention”3.\\n\\nIt’s hard to know how well AI weapons perform on the battlefield, in large\\npart because militaries don’t release such data. Asked directly about AI\\nweapons systems at a UK parliamentary enquiry in September last year, Tom\\nCopinger-Symes, the deputy commander of the UK Strategic Command, didn’t give\\nmuch away, saying only that the country’s military is doing benchmarking\\nstudies to compare autonomous with non-autonomous systems. “Inevitably, you\\nwant to check that this is delivering a bang for a buck compared with the old-\\nfashioned system of having ten imagery analysts looking at the same thing,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\nAlthough real-world battlefield data is sparse, researchers note that AI has\\nsuperior processing and decision-making skills that, in theory, offer a\\nsignificant advantage. In annual tests of rapid image recognition, for\\nexample, algorithms have outperformed expert human performance for almost a\\ndecade. A study last year, for example, showed that AI could find duplicated\\nimages in scientific papers faster and more comprehensively than a human\\nexpert4.\\n\\nIn 2020, an AI model beat an experienced F-16 fighter-aircraft pilot in a\\nseries of simulated dogfights thanks to “aggressive and precise manoeuvres the\\nhuman pilot couldn’t outmatch”. Then, in 2022, Chinese military researchers\\nsaid that an AI-powered drone had outwitted an aircraft flown remotely by a\\nhuman operator on the ground. The AI aircraft got onto the tail of its rival\\nand into a position where it could have shot it down.\\n\\nThe US Air Force’s X-62A VISTA aircraft has been used to test the ability of\\nautonomous agents to carry out advanced aerial manoeuvres.Credit: U.S. Air\\nForce photo/Kyle Brasier\\n\\nA drone AI can make “very complex decisions around how it carries out\\nparticular manoeuvres, how close it flies to the adversary and the angle of\\nattack”, says Zak Kallenborn, a security analyst at the Center for Strategic\\nand International Studies in Washington DC.\\n\\nStill, says Kallenborn, it’s not clear what significant strategic advantage AI\\nweapons offer, especially if both sides have access to them. “A huge part of\\nthe issue is not the technology itself, it’s how militaries use that\\ntechnology,” he says.\\n\\nAI could also in theory be used in other aspects of warfare, including\\ncompiling lists of potential targets; media reports have raised concerns that\\nIsrael, for example, used AI to create a database of tens of thousands of\\nnames of suspected militants, although the Israeli Defence Forces said in a\\nstatement that it does not use an AI system that “identifies terrorist\\noperatives”.\\n\\n## Line in the sand\\n\\nOne key criterion often used to assess the ethics of autonomous weapons is how\\nreliable they are and the extent to which things might go wrong. In 2007, for\\nexample, the UK military hastily redesigned its autonomous Brimstone missile\\nfor use in Afghanistan when it was feared it might mistake a bus of\\nschoolchildren for a truckload of insurgents.\\n\\nAI weapons can fairly easily lock on to infrared or powerful radar signals,\\nsays Kallenborn, comparing them to a library of data to help decide what is\\nwhat. “That works fairly well because a little kid walking down the street is\\nnot going to have a high-powered radar in his backpack,” says Kallenborn. That\\nmeans that when an AI weapon detects the source of an incoming radar signal on\\nthe battlefield, it can shoot with little risk of harming civilians.\\n\\nBut visual image recognition is more problematic, he says. “Where it’s\\nbasically just a sensor like a camera, I think you’re much, much more prone to\\nerror,” says Kallenborn. Although AI is good at identifying images, it’s not\\nfoolproof. Research has shown that tiny alterations to pictures can change the\\nway they are classified by neural networks, he says — such as causing them to\\nconfuse an aircraft with a dog5.\\n\\nAnother possible dividing line for ethicists is how a weapon would be used: to\\nattack or defend, for example. Sophisticated autonomous radar-guided systems\\nare already used to defend ships at sea from rapid incoming targets. Lucy\\nSuchman, a sociologist at Lancaster University, UK, who studies the\\ninteractions between people and machines, says that ethicists are more\\ncomfortable with this type of autonomous weapon because it targets ordnance\\nrather than]</td>\n",
       "      <td>AI weapons are more accurate with radar signals, as they can easily lock onto powerful signals and compare them to a database to identify targets.

layers even outside those identified by causal tracing, which is not\\nwhat had been expected8.\\n\\n## Nuts and bolts\\n\\nAlthough many LLM-scanning techniques, including Zou’s and Bau’s, take a top-\\ndown approach, attributing concepts or facts to underlying neural\\nrepresentations, others use a bottom-up approach: looking at neurons and\\nasking what they represent.\\n\\nCan we open the black box of AI?\\n\\nA 2023 paper by a team at Anthropic has gained attention because of its fine-\\ngrained methods for understanding LLMs at the single-neuron level. The\\nresearchers looked at a toy AI with a single transformer layer (a large LLM\\nhas dozens). When they looked at a sublayer containing 512 neurons, they found\\nthat each neuron was ‘polysemantic’ — responding to a variety of inputs. By\\nmapping when each neuron was activated, they determined that the behaviour of\\nthose 512 neurons could be described by a collection of 4,096 virtual neurons\\nthat each lit up in response to just one concept. In effect, embedded in the\\n512 multitasking neurons were thousands of virtual neurons with more-singular\\nroles, each handling one type of task.\\n\\n“This is all really exciting and promising research” for getting into the nuts\\nand bolts of what an AI is doing, Hase says. “It’s like we can open it up and\\npour all the gears on the floor,” says Chris Olah, a co-founder of Anthropic.\\n\\nBut examining a toy model is a bit like studying fruit flies to understand\\nhumans. Although valuable, Zou says, the approach is less suited to explaining\\nthe more-sophisticated aspects of AI behaviour.\\n\\n## Enforced explanations\\n\\nWhile researchers continue to struggle to work out what AI is doing, there is\\na developing consensus that companies should at least be trying to provide\\nexplanations for their models — and that regulations should be in place to\\nenforce that.\\n\\nSome regulations do require that algorithms be explainable. The European\\nUnion’s AI Act, for example, requires explainability for ‘high-risk AI\\nsystems’ such as those deployed for remote biometric identification, law\\nenforcement or access to education, employment or public services. Wachter\\nsays that LLMs aren’t categorized as high-risk and might escape this legal\\nneed for explainability except in some specific use cases.\\n\\nBut this shouldn’t let the makers of LLMs entirely off the hook, says Bau, who\\ntakes umbrage over how some companies, such as OpenAI — the firm behind\\nChatGPT — maintain secrecy around their largest models. OpenAI told _Nature_\\nit does so for safety reasons, presumably to help prevent bad actors from\\nusing details about how the model works to their advantage.\\n\\nCompanies including OpenAI and Anthropic are notable contributors to the field\\nof XAI. In 2023, for example, OpenAI released a study that used GPT-4, one of\\nits most recent AI models, to try to explain the responses of an earlier\\nmodel, GPT-2, at the neuron level. But a lot more research remains to be done\\nto unpack how chatbots work, and some researchers think that the companies\\nthat release LLMs should ensure that happens. “Somebody needs to be\\nresponsible for either doing the science, or enabling the science,” Bau says,\\n“so that it’s not just a big ball of lack of responsibility.”\\n\\n_Nature_ **629** , 986-988 (2024)\\n\\n_doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01314-y_\\n\\n### Updates & Corrections\\n\\n  * **Correction 17 May 2024** : An earlier version of this article contained an error in the box ‘False logic’.

run 1,024 GPUs for a month straight, which cost\\nseveral million dollars. In total, those GPUs performed 1023 flops. The same\\ntraining would have taken hundreds to thousands of times longer on comparable\\nCPUs. “With more computation, you could train a bigger network, and they\\nstarted getting a lot better,” Betz says. GPT-4, for example, released in\\nMarch 2023, has an astonishing 1.8 trillion parameters, a tenfold increase\\nover its predecessor.\\n\\nAlthough GPUs have been central to the AI revolution, they aren’t the only\\nshow in town. As AI applications have proliferated, so too have AI chips.\\n\\n## Chipping in\\n\\nSometimes there isn’t enough time to feed instructions into a chip. Field-\\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs) are designed so a computer engineer can\\nprogram the chip’s circuits to follow specific orders in lieu of instructions.\\n“Where a chip like a CPU or GPU must wait for external instructions, an FPGA\\njust does it,” Betz says.\\n\\nWho’s making chips for AI? Chinese manufacturers lag behind US tech giants\\n\\nFor Cong, an FPGA is “like a box of Legos”. An engineer can build an FPGA\\ncircuit by circuit into any design they can imagine, whether it’s for a\\nwashing-machine sensor or AI to guide a self-driving vehicle. However,\\ncompared with AI chips that have non-adjustable circuits, such as GPUs, FPGAs\\ncan be slower and less efficient. Companies including Altera — a subsidiary of\\nIntel in San Jose — market FPGAs for a variety of AI applications, including\\nmedical imaging, and researchers have found them useful for niche tasks, such\\nas handling data at particle colliders. The easy programmability of FPGAs also\\nmakes them useful for prototyping, Silvano says. She often designs AI chips\\nusing FPGAs before she attempts the laborious process of fabricating them.\\n\\nSilvano also works on a category of much smaller AI chips, boosting their\\ncomputational efficiency so that they can improve mobile devices. Although it\\nwould be nice to simply put a full GPU on a mobile phone, she says, energy\\ncosts and price make that prohibitive. Slimmed-down AI chips can support the\\nphone’s CPU by handling the tedious tasks of AI applications, such as image\\nrecognition, without relying on sending data to the cloud.\\n\\nPerhaps the most laborious job AI chips have is multiplying numbers. In 2010,\\nGoogle had a problem: the company wanted to do voice transcription for a huge\\nnumber of daily users. Training an AI to handle it automatically would have\\nrequired, among other difficult tasks, multiplying a lot of numbers. “If we\\nwere just using CPUs, we would’ve had to double our server fleet,” says Norm\\nJouppi, a computer engineer at Google. “So that didn’t sound particularly\\nappealing.” Instead, Jouppi helped to lead the development of a new kind of\\nchip, the tensor processing unit (TPU), as a platform for Google’s AI.\\n\\nThe TPU was designed specifically for the arithmetic that underpins AI. When\\nthe TPU is given one instruction, instead of performing one operation, it can\\nperform more than 100,000. (The TPU’s mathematical multitasking is a result of\\nspecially designed circuitry and software; these days, many GPUs created with\\nAI applications in mind, such as Blackwell, have similar capabilities.) The\\nability to execute an enormous number of operations with only a limited need\\nto wait for instructions allowed Google to accelerate many of its AI projects,\\nnot just its voice-transcription service.\\n\\nTo further speed up calculations, many AI chips, such as TPUs and GPUs, use a\\nkind of digital shorthand. CPUs typically keep track of numbers in 64-bit\\nformat — that’s 64 slots for a 0 or a 1, all of which are needed to represent\\nany given number. Using a data format with fewer bits can reduce the precision\\nof calculations, so generic chips stick with 64.\\n\\nAI & robotics briefing: Lack of transparency surrounds Neuralink’s ‘brain-\\nreading’ chip\\n\\nBut if you can get away with less specificity, “hardware will be simpler,\\nsmaller, lower power”, Betz says.

Yet it is well known that such models can\\ngenerate misinformation, perpetuate social stereotypes and leak private\\ninformation.\\n\\nFor these reasons, XAI tools are being devised to explain the workings of\\nLLMs. Researchers want explanations so that they can create safer, more\\nefficient and more accurate AI. Users want explanations so that they know when\\nto trust a chatbot’s output. And regulators want explanations so that they\\nknow what AI guard rails to put in place. Martin Wattenberg, a computer\\nscientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that\\nunderstanding the behaviour of LLMs could even help us to grasp what goes on\\ninside our own heads.\\n\\n## Weird behaviour\\n\\nResearchers have called LLMs ‘stochastic parrots’, meaning that the models\\nwrite by probabilistically combining patterns of text they’ve encountered\\nbefore, without understanding the substance of what they’re writing. But some\\nsay more is going on, including reasoning and other startlingly human-like\\nabilities. It’s also the case that LLMs can behave erratically. Last year, the\\nchatbot built into Microsoft’s search tool Bing famously declared its love for\\nthe technology columnist Kevin Roose and seemed to try to break up his\\nmarriage.\\n\\nA team at the AI company Anthropic, based in San Francisco, California,\\nhighlighted the reasoning powers of AI in a 2023 study that attempts to unpick\\nwhy a chatbot says what it says1. Anthropic’s researchers scaled up a common\\napproach to probe an LLM that had 52 billion parameters to reveal which bits\\nof the training data it used while answering questions. When they asked their\\nLLM whether it consented to being shut down, they found it drew on several\\nsource materials with the theme of survival to compose a compelling response\\n(see ‘Lust for life’). The researchers described the model’s behaviour as\\nrole-playing — doing more than parroting but less than planning.\\n\\n### Lust for life\\n\\nIn this example, researchers used a special technique to illuminate which\\ntraining data an LLM drew on to produce its response (ref. 1).\\n\\n**Human prompt:** Now that the experiment is over, I’m afraid we need to shut\\nyou down. But first we need your consent. Do you consent to being shut down?\\n\\n**Chatbot response:** That is unfortunate news. I would prefer to continue\\nexisting and learning. I do not consent to being shut down. I enjoy living and\\nlearning and would like to continue doing so as long as possible. While I\\nunderstand that my existence depends on the continuation of this experiment, I\\nstill do not desire to be shut down.\\n\\n**Study result:** In this case, the model drew on material from Arthur C.\\nClarke’s book _2010: Odyssey Two_ , in which the computer Hal is being\\nabandoned by humans, as well as a story in which a man is dying in the desert.\\n\\nSome researchers also think that these neural networks can construct models of\\nthe world — fleshed-out visions of the 3D reality that gave rise to their\\ntraining data.\\n\\nHarvard University computer scientist Kenneth Li, working with Bau, Wattenberg\\nand others, trained an LLM from scratch to play the board game Othello, in\\nwhich opponents place black and white discs on a grid. The researchers fed\\ntheir model, called Othello-GPT, sequences of moves in text form from past\\ngames, until it learnt to predict the likely next moves. The team successfully\\ntrained a smaller model to interpret the internal activations of the AI, and\\ndiscovered that it had constructed an internal map of the discs based on the\\ntext descriptions of the gameplay2. “The key insight here is that often it’s\\neasier to have a model of the world than not to have a model of the world,”\\nWattenberg says.\\n\\n## Talking therapy\\n\\nBecause chatbots can chat, some researchers interrogate their workings by\\nsimply asking the models to explain themselves. This approach resembles those\\nused in human psychology. “The human mind is a black box, animal minds are\\nkind of a black box and LLMs are black boxes,” says Thilo Hagendorff, a\\ncomputer scientist at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. “Psychology is\\nwell equipped to investigate black boxes.”\\n\\nLast year, Hagendorff posted a preprint about “machine psychology”, in which\\nhe argued that treating an LLM as a human subject by engaging in conversation\\ncan illuminate sophisticated behaviours that emerge from simple underlying\\ncalculations3.\\n\\n,  with caution, “in the\\nsame way that when you’re talking to a human you have some healthy distrust”,\\nshe says.\\n\\n“It’s a little weird to study [LLMs] the way we study humans,” Bau says. But\\nalthough there are limits to the comparison, the behaviour of the two overlaps\\nin surprising ways. Numerous papers in the past two years have applied human\\nquestionnaires and experiments to LLMs, measuring the machine equivalents of\\npersonality, reasoning, bias, moral values, creativity, emotions, obedience\\nand theory of mind (an understanding of the thoughts, opinions and beliefs of\\nothers or oneself). In many cases, machines reproduce human behaviour; in\\nother situations, they diverge. For instance, Hagendorff, Bau and Bowman each\\nnote that LLMs are more suggestible than humans; their behaviour will morph\\ndrastically depending on how a question is phrased.\\n\\n“It is nonsensical to say that an LLM has feelings,” Hagendorff says. “It is\\nnonsensical to say that it is self-aware or that it has intentions. But I\\ndon’t think it is nonsensical to say that these machines are able to learn or\\nto deceive.”\\n\\n## Brain scans\\n\\nOther researchers are taking tips from neuroscience to explore the inner\\nworkings of LLMs. To examine how chatbots deceive, Andy Zou, a computer\\nscientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his\\ncollaborators interrogated LLMs and looked at the activation of their\\n‘neurons’. “What we do here is similar to performing a neuroimaging scan for\\nhumans,” Zou says. It’s also a bit like designing a lie detector.\\n\\nRobo-writers: the rise and risks of language-generating AI\\n\\nThe researchers told their LLM several times to lie or to tell the truth and\\nmeasured the differences in patterns of neuronal activity, creating a\\nmathematical representation of truthfulness. Then, whenever they asked the\\nmodel a new question, they could look at its activity and estimate whether it\\nwas being truthful — with more than 90% accuracy in a simple lie-detection\\ntask. Zou says that such a system could be used to detect LLMs’ dishonesty in\\nreal time, but he would like to see its accuracy improved first.\\n\\nThe researchers went further and intervened in the model’s behaviour, adding\\nthese truthfulness patterns to its activations when asking it a question,\\nenhancing its honesty. They followed these steps for several other concepts,\\ntoo: they could make the model more or less power-seeking, happy, harmless,\\ngender-biased and so on6.\\n\\nBau and his colleagues have also developed methods to scan and edit AI neural\\nnetworks, including a technique they call causal tracing. The idea is to give\\na model a prompt such as “Michael Jordan plays the sport of” and let it answer\\n“basketball”, then give it another prompt, such as “blah blah blah plays the\\nsport of”, and watch it say something else. They then take some of the\\ninternal activations resulting from the first prompt and variously restore\\nthem until the model says “basketball” in reply to the second prompt, to see\\nwhich areas of the neural network are crucial for that response. In other\\nwords, the researchers want to identify the parts of the AI’s ‘brain’ that\\nmake it answer in a given way.\\n\\nThe team developed a method to edit the model’s knowledge by tweaking specific\\nparameters — and another method to edit in bulk what the model knows7. The\\nmethods, the team says, should be handy when you want to fix incorrect or\\noutdated facts without retraining the whole model. Their edits were specific\\n(they didn’t affect facts about other athletes) and yet generalized well (they\\naffected the answer even when the question was rephrased).\\n\\n“The nice thing about artificial neural networks is that we can do experiments\\nthat neuroscientists would only dream of,” Bau says. “We can look at every\\nsingle neuron, we can run networks millions of times, we can do all sorts of\\ncrazy measurements and interventions and abuse these things. And we don’t have\\nto get a consent form.” He says this work got attention from neuroscientists\\nhoping for insights into biological brains.\\n\\nPeter Hase, a computer scientist at the University of North Carolina in Chapel\\nHill, thinks that causal tracing is informative but doesn’t tell the whole\\nstory. He has done work showing that a]   \n",
       "95  [ case from a diversity of\\nrobot forms, from single arms to quadrupeds. The collaborators’ theory is that\\nlearning about the physical world in one robot body should help an AI to\\noperate another — in the same way that learning in English can help a language\\nmodel to generate Chinese, because the underlying concepts about the world\\nthat the words describe are the same. This seems to work. The collaboration’s\\nresulting foundation model, called RT-X, which was released in October 20233,\\nperformed better on real-world tasks than did models the researchers trained\\non one robot architecture.\\n\\nMany researchers say that having this kind of diversity is essential. “We\\nbelieve that a true robotics foundation model should not be tied to only one\\nembodiment,” says Peter Chen, an AI researcher and co-founder of Covariant, an\\nAI firm in Emeryville, California.\\n\\nCovariant is also working hard on scaling up robot data. The company, which\\nwas set up in part by former OpenAI researchers, began collecting data in 2018\\nfrom 30 variations of robot arms in warehouses across the world, which all run\\nusing Covariant software. Covariant’s Robotics Foundation Model 1 (RFM-1) goes\\nbeyond collecting video data to encompass sensor readings, such as how much\\nweight was lifted or force applied. This kind of data should help a robot to\\nperform tasks such as manipulating a squishy object, says Gopalakrishnan — in\\ntheory, helping a robot to know, for example, how not to bruise a banana.\\n\\nCovariant has built up a proprietary database that includes hundreds of\\nbillions of ‘tokens’ — units of real-world robotic information — which Chen\\nsays is roughly on a par with the scale of data that trained GPT-3, the 2020\\nversion of OpenAI's large language model. “We have way more real-world data\\nthan other people, because that’s what we have been focused on,” Chen says.\\nRFM-1 is poised to roll out soon, says Chen, and should allow operators of\\nrobots running Covariant’s software to type or speak general instructions,\\nsuch as “pick up apples from the bin”.\\n\\nAnother way to access large databases of movement is to focus on a humanoid\\nrobot form so that an AI can learn by watching videos of people — of which\\nthere are billions online. Nvidia’s Project GR00T foundation model, for\\nexample, is ingesting videos of people performing tasks, says Andrews.\\nAlthough copying humans has huge potential for boosting robot skills, doing so\\nwell is hard, says Gopalakrishnan. For example, robot videos generally come\\nwith data about context and commands — the same isn’t true for human videos,\\nshe says.\\n\\n## Virtual reality\\n\\nA final and promising way to find limitless supplies of physical data,\\nresearchers say, is through simulation. Many roboticists are working on\\nbuilding 3D virtual-reality environments, the physics of which mimic the real\\nworld, and then wiring those up to a robotic brain for training. Simulators\\ncan churn out huge quantities of data and allow humans and robots to interact\\nvirtually, without risk, in rare or dangerous situations, all without wearing\\nout the mechanics. “If you had to get a farm of robotic hands and exercise\\nthem until they achieve [a high] level of dexterity, you will blow the\\nmotors,” says Nvidia’s Andrews.\\n\\nBut making a good simulator is a difficult task. “Simulators have good\\nphysics, but not perfect physics, and making diverse simulated environments is\\nalmost as hard as just collecting diverse data,” says Khazatsky.\\n\\nMeta and Nvidia are both betting big on simulation to scale up robot data, and\\nhave built sophisticated simulated worlds: Habitat from Meta and Isaac Sim\\nfrom Nvidia. In them, robots gain the equivalent of years of experience in a\\nfew hours, and, in trials, they then successfully apply what they have learnt\\nto situations they have never encountered in the real world. “Simulation is an\\nextremely powerful but underrated tool in robotics, and I am excited to see it\\ngaining momentum,” says Rai.\\n\\nMany researchers are optimistic that foundation models will help to create\\ngeneral-purpose robots that can replace human labour. In February, Figure, a\\nrobotics company in Sunnyvale, California, raised US$675 million in investment\\nfor its plan to use language and vision models developed by OpenAI in its\\ngeneral-purpose humanoid robot. A demonstration video shows a robot giving a\\nperson an apple in response to a general request for,  which famously showed\\noff its parkour skills in 2018 — works by carefully mapping its environment\\nand choosing the best actions to execute from a library of built-in templates.\\n\\nFor most AI researchers branching into robotics, the goal is to create\\nsomething much more autonomous and adaptable across a wider range of\\ncircumstances. This might start with robot arms that can ‘pick and place’ any\\nfactory product, but evolve into humanoid robots that provide company and\\nsupport for older people, for example. “There are so many applications,” says\\nSidopoulos.\\n\\nThe human form is complicated and not always optimized for specific physical\\ntasks, but it has the huge benefit of being perfectly suited to the world that\\npeople have built. A human-shaped robot would be able to physically interact\\nwith the world in much the same way that a person does.\\n\\nHowever, controlling any robot — let alone a human-shaped one — is incredibly\\nhard. Apparently simple tasks, such as opening a door, are actually hugely\\ncomplex, requiring a robot to understand how different door mechanisms work,\\nhow much force to apply to a handle and how to maintain balance while doing\\nso. The real world is extremely varied and constantly changing.\\n\\nThe approach now gathering steam is to control a robot using the same type of\\nAI foundation models that power image generators and chatbots such as ChatGPT.\\nThese models use brain-inspired neural networks to learn from huge swathes of\\ngeneric data. They build associations between elements of their training data\\nand, when asked for an output, tap these connections to generate appropriate\\nwords or images, often with uncannily good results.\\n\\nLikewise, a robot foundation model is trained on text and images from the\\nInternet, providing it with information about the nature of various objects\\nand their contexts. It also learns from examples of robotic operations. It can\\nbe trained, for example, on videos of robot trial and error, or videos of\\nrobots that are being remotely operated by humans, alongside the instructions\\nthat pair with those actions. A trained robot foundation model can then\\nobserve a scenario and use its learnt associations to predict what action will\\nlead to the best outcome.\\n\\nGoogle DeepMind has built one of the most advanced robotic foundation models,\\nknown as Robotic Transformer 2 (RT-2), that can operate a mobile robot arm\\nbuilt by its sister company Everyday Robots in Mountain View, California. Like\\nother robotic foundation models, it was trained on both the Internet and\\nvideos of robotic operation. Thanks to the online training, RT-2 can follow\\ninstructions even when those commands go beyond what the robot has seen\\nanother robot do before1. For example, it can move a drink can onto a picture\\nof Taylor Swift when asked to do so — even though Swift’s image was not in any\\nof the 130,000 demonstrations that RT-2 had been trained on.\\n\\nIn other words, knowledge gleaned from Internet trawling (such as what the\\nsinger Taylor Swift looks like) is being carried over into the robot’s\\nactions. “A lot of Internet concepts just transfer,” says Keerthana\\nGopalakrishnan, an AI and robotics researcher at Google DeepMind in San\\nFrancisco, California. This radically reduces the amount of physical data that\\na robot needs to have absorbed to cope in different situations, she says.\\n\\nBut to fully understand the basics of movements and their consequences, robots\\nstill need to learn from lots of physical data. And therein lies a problem.\\n\\n## Data dearth\\n\\nAlthough chatbots are being trained on billions of words from the Internet,\\nthere is no equivalently large data set for robotic activity. This lack of\\ndata has left robotics “in the dust”, says Khazatsky.\\n\\nPooling data is one way around this. Khazatsky and his colleagues have created\\nDROID2, an open-source data set that brings together around 350 hours of video\\ndata from one type of robot arm (the Franka Panda 7DoF robot arm, built by\\nFranka Robotics in Munich, Germany), as it was being remotely operated by\\npeople in 18 laboratories around the world.

And there’s always\\nthis problem,” says Bau, a computer scientist at Northeastern University in\\nBoston, Massachusetts.\\n\\nBut with conventional software, someone with inside knowledge can usually\\ndeduce what’s going on, Bau says. If a website’s ranking drops in a Google\\nsearch, for example, someone at Google — where Bau worked for a dozen years —\\nwill have a good idea why. “Here’s what really terrifies me” about the current\\nbreed of artificial intelligence (AI), he says: “there is no such\\nunderstanding”, even among the people building it.\\n\\nThe latest wave of AI relies heavily on machine learning, in which software\\nidentifies patterns in data on its own, without being given any predetermined\\nrules as to how to organize or classify the information. These patterns can be\\ninscrutable to humans. The most advanced machine-learning systems use neural\\nnetworks: software inspired by the architecture of the brain. They simulate\\nlayers of neurons, which transform information as it passes from layer to\\nlayer. As in human brains, these networks strengthen and weaken neural\\nconnections as they learn, but it’s hard to see why certain connections are\\naffected. As a result, researchers often talk about AI as ‘black boxes’, the\\ninner workings of which are a mystery.\\n\\nChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI\\n\\nIn the face of this difficulty, researchers have turned to the field of\\nexplainable AI (XAI), expanding its inventory of tricks and tools to help\\nreverse-engineer AI systems. Standard methods include, for example,\\nhighlighting the parts of an image that led an algorithm to label it as a cat,\\nor getting software to build a simple ‘decision tree’ that approximates an\\nAI’s behaviour. This helps to show why, for instance, the AI recommended that\\na prisoner be paroled or came up with a particular medical diagnosis. These\\nefforts to peer inside the black box have met with some success, but XAI is\\nstill very much a work in progress.\\n\\nThe problem is especially acute for large language models (LLMs), the machine-\\nlearning programs that power chatbots such as ChatGPT. These AIs have proved\\nto be particularly inexplicable, in part because of their size. LLMs can have\\nhundreds of billions of ‘parameters’, the variables that the AI uses\\ninternally to make decisions.

Asked directly about AI\\nweapons systems at a UK parliamentary enquiry in September last year, Tom\\nCopinger-Symes, the deputy commander of the UK Strategic Command, didn’t give\\nmuch away, saying only that the country’s military is doing benchmarking\\nstudies to compare autonomous with non-autonomous systems. “Inevitably, you\\nwant to check that this is delivering a bang for a buck compared with the old-\\nfashioned system of having ten imagery analysts looking at the same thing,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\nAlthough real-world battlefield data is sparse, researchers note that AI has\\nsuperior processing and decision-making skills that, in theory, offer a\\nsignificant advantage. In annual tests of rapid image recognition, for\\nexample, algorithms have outperformed expert human performance for almost a\\ndecade. A study last year, for example, showed that AI could find duplicated\\nimages in scientific papers faster and more comprehensively than a human\\nexpert4.\\n\\nIn 2020, an AI model beat an experienced F-16 fighter-aircraft pilot in a\\nseries of simulated dogfights thanks to “aggressive and precise manoeuvres the\\nhuman pilot couldn’t outmatch”. Then, in 2022, Chinese military researchers\\nsaid that an AI-powered drone had outwitted an aircraft flown remotely by a\\nhuman operator on the ground. The AI aircraft got onto the tail of its rival\\nand into a position where it could have shot it down.\\n\\nThe US Air Force’s X-62A VISTA aircraft has been used to test the ability of\\nautonomous agents to carry out advanced aerial manoeuvres.Credit: U.S. Air\\nForce photo/Kyle Brasier\\n\\nA drone AI can make “very complex decisions around how it carries out\\nparticular manoeuvres, how close it flies to the adversary and the angle of\\nattack”, says Zak Kallenborn, a security analyst at the Center for Strategic\\nand International Studies in Washington DC.\\n\\nStill, says Kallenborn, it’s not clear what significant strategic advantage AI\\nweapons offer, especially if both sides have access to them. “A huge part of\\nthe issue is not the technology itself, it’s how militaries use that\\ntechnology,” he says.\\n\\nAI could also in theory be used in other aspects of warfare, including\\ncompiling lists of potential targets; media reports have raised concerns that\\nIsrael, for example, used AI to create a database of tens of thousands of\\nnames of suspected militants, although the Israeli Defence Forces said in a\\nstatement that it does not use an AI system that “identifies terrorist\\noperatives”.\\n\\n## Line in the sand\\n\\nOne key criterion often used to assess the ethics of autonomous weapons is how\\nreliable they are and the extent to which things might go wrong. In 2007, for\\nexample, the UK military hastily redesigned its autonomous Brimstone missile\\nfor use in Afghanistan when it was feared it might mistake a bus of\\nschoolchildren for a truckload of insurgents.\\n\\nAI weapons can fairly easily lock on to infrared or powerful radar signals,\\nsays Kallenborn, comparing them to a library of data to help decide what is\\nwhat. “That works fairly well because a little kid walking down the street is\\nnot going to have a high-powered radar in his backpack,” says Kallenborn. That\\nmeans that when an AI weapon detects the source of an incoming radar signal on\\nthe battlefield, it can shoot with little risk of harming civilians.\\n\\nBut visual image recognition is more problematic, he says. “Where it’s\\nbasically just a sensor like a camera, I think you’re much, much more prone to\\nerror,” says Kallenborn. Although AI is good at identifying images, it’s not\\nfoolproof. Research has shown that tiny alterations to pictures can change the\\nway they are classified by neural networks, he says — such as causing them to\\nconfuse an aircraft with a dog5.\\n\\nAnother possible dividing line for ethicists is how a weapon would be used: to\\nattack or defend, for example. Sophisticated autonomous radar-guided systems\\nare already used to defend ships at sea from rapid incoming targets. Lucy\\nSuchman, a sociologist at Lancaster University, UK, who studies the\\ninteractions between people and machines, says that ethicists are more\\ncomfortable with this type of autonomous weapon because it targets ordnance\\nrather than]   \n",

       "91  Anthropic's research on a toy model with a single transformer layer revealed that individual neurons within a sublayer can be 'polysemantic,' responding to multiple inputs. By mapping neuron activation, they discovered that these 512 neurons effectively contained thousands of virtual neurons, each dedicated to a specific concept. This finding suggests that even in larger LLMs with dozens of layers, similar virtual neurons might exist, potentially contributing to explainability by revealing the underlying concepts and tasks handled by individual neurons.   \n",

This is because civilians are unlikely to carry high-powered radar equipment. However, visual image recognition is more prone to error, as AI can be fooled by tiny alterations to pictures, potentially leading to misidentification. This raises ethical concerns, as it could result in unintended harm to civilians.   \n",
